            <p>To ensure transparency and align our incentives with our clients, SudoSupport operates on a decentralized foundation built on the Base L2 blockchain. This is not just technology for technology's sake; it is a core part of our commitment to a world without intermediaries.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Blockchain?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All funding and project expenditures can be publicly audited, ensuring funds are used to improve the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> By using a public blockchain, we escape the fees and control of traditional banking and payment processors.</li>
                <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> The use of <code>$DEED</code> NFTs provides cryptographic proof of your relationship and stake within our ecosystem.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Getting Started: Your Wallet is Your Key</h2>
            <p>The consultation process requires a self-custody crypto wallet. The system does <strong>not</strong> create a wallet for you; you must provide your own. This ensures that you, and only you, have control over your digital identity and assets.</p>

            <h3>1. Acquiring ETH on Base:</h3>
            <p>Our network operates on Base, a secure and low-cost Ethereum Layer 2. To interact with it, you will need Ether (ETH) on the Base network for transaction fees (gas). You can acquire this by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bridging:</strong> If you already have ETH on Ethereum, you can move it to Base using the official <a href="https://bridge.base.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Base Bridge</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>On-ramps:</strong> You can purchase ETH directly onto the Base network through services like Coinbase.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Recommended Wallets:</h3>
            <p>If you are new to crypto, here are some user-friendly and secure wallets to get you started:</p>
